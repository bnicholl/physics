c = 3 * 10 ** 8 #speed of light

# The speed of light through matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light
# interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the 
# type of material, since its interaction varies with different atoms, crystal 
# lattices, and other substructures. We can define a constant of a material that
# describes the speed of light in it, called the index of refraction n:
    
#v = observed speed of light in the vacum/medium  
#n = c / v

# ti simplifiy, say 
# c = 10 and 
# v = 5, then 
# n = 2, which means v is twice as slow as c
# i5 we want to know v, and we only know c and n, divide c / n
10 / 2 = 5 # where 5 was our original v

# for gases, n is close to 1.0 because atoms in gases are widely separated,
