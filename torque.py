#Since forces change the translational motion of objects, the rotational counterpart #must be related to changing the rotational motion of an object about an axis. We call #this rotational counterpart torque."""In everyday life, we rotate objects about an axis all the time, so intuitively we already know much about torque. Consider, for example, how we rotate a door to open it. First, we know that a door opens slowly if we push too close to its hinges; it is more efficient to rotate a door open if we push far from the hinges. Second, we knowthat we should push perpendicular to the plane of the door; if we push parallel to the plane of the door, we are not able to rotate it. Third, the larger the force, the more effective it is in opening the door; the harder you push, the more rapidlythe door opens. The first point implies that the farther the force is applied from the axis of rotation, the greater the angular acceleration; the second implies thatthe effectiveness depends on the angle at which the force is applied; the third implies that the magnitude of the force must also be part of the equation. Notethat for rotation in a plane, torque has two possible directions. Torque is eitherclockwise or counterclockwise relative to the chosen pivot point. Figure 10.31 shows counterclockwise rotations."""#https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1@20.1/pages/10-6-torque#Four forces are shown in Figure 10.34 at particular locations and orientations#with respect to a given xy-coordinate system.
